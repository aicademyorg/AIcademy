Operators are symbols used to perform operations on variables and values, such as arithmetic calculations, comparisons, or logical checks.

Let's explore the most commonly used operators in Python:

## Arithmetic Operators

These are used to do basic math operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.

| Operator | Description                  | Syntax   |
| -------- | ---------------------------- | -------- |
| `+`      | Addition                     | `x + y`  |
| `-`      | Subtraction                  | `x - y`  |
| `*`      | Multiplication               | `x * y`  |
| `/`      | Division (decimal)           | `x / y`  |
| `//`     | Floor Division (rounds down) | `x // y` |
| `%`      | Modulus (remainder)          | `x % y`  |
| `**`     | Power (exponent)             | `x ** y` |

Example:

```py
a = 7
b = 2

print(a + b)   # Addition
print(a - b)   # Subtraction
print(a * b)   # Multiplication
print(a / b)   # Division
print(a // b)  # Floor Division
print(a % b)   # Modulus
print(a ** b)  # Exponent
```

Output:

```sh
9
5
14
3.5
3
1
49
```

## Comparison Operators

These are used to compare two values. The result is either `True` or `False`.

| Operator | Description              | Syntax   |
| -------- | ------------------------ | -------- |
| `>`      | Greater than             | `x > y`  |
| `<`      | Less than                | `x < y`  |
| `==`     | Equal to                 | `x == y` |
| `!=`     | Not equal to             | `x != y` |
| `>=`     | Greater than or equal to | `x >= y` |
| `<=`     | Less than or equal to    | `x <= y` |

Example:

```py
x = 8
y = 10

print(x > y)   # Greater than
print(x < y)   # Less than
print(x == y)  # Equal to
print(x != y)  # Not equal to
print(x >= y)  # Greater than or equal to
print(x <= y)  # Less than or equal to
```

Output:

```sh
False
True
False
True
False
True
```

## Logical Operators

These are used to combine multiple conditions.

| Operator | Description                      | Syntax    | Example            |
| -------- | -------------------------------- | --------- | ------------------ |
| `and`    | True if both conditions are true | `x and y` | `x > 5 and x < 10` |
| `or`     | True if at least one is true     | `x or y`  | `x < 5 or x > 15`  |
| `not`    | Reverses the condition           | `not x`   | `not(x > 5)`       |

Example:

```py
x = 7
print(x > 5 and x < 10)  # True
print(x < 5 or x > 10)   # False
print(not(x > 5))        # False
```

Output:

```sh
True
False
False
```

## Bitwise Operators

Bitwise operators work with binary (0s and 1s). These are advanced but useful for certain tasks.

| Operator | Description         | Syntax   |
| -------- | ------------------- | -------- |
| `&`      | Bitwise AND         | `x & y`  |
| `~`      | Bitwise NOT         | `~x`     |
| `^`      | Bitwise XOR         | `x ^ y`  |
| `>>`     | Bitwise right shift | `x >> y` |
| `<<`     | Bitwise left shift  | `x << y` |

Example:

```py
a = 6
b = 3

print(a & b)    # AND
print(~a)       # NOT
print(a ^ b)    # XOR
print(a >> 1)   # Right shift
print(a << 1)   # Left shift
```

Output:

```sh
2
-7
5
3
12
```

## Assignment Operators

These are used to assign values to variables, sometimes after performing a calculation.

| Operator | Meaning                       | Example   |
| -------- | ----------------------------- | --------- |
| `=`      | Assign value                  | `x = 5`   |
| `+=`     | Add and assign                | `x += 2`  |
| `-=`     | Subtract and assign           | `x -= 2`  |
| `*=`     | Multiply and assign           | `x *= 2`  |
| `/=`     | Divide and assign             | `x /= 2`  |
| `//=`    | Floor divide and assign       | `x //= 2` |
| `%=`     | Modulus and assign            | `x %= 2`  |
| `**=`    | Power and assign              | `x **= 2` |
| `:=`     | Assign in expression (Walrus) | `x := 5`  |

Example:

```py
# = : Assign value
x = 5
print(x)  # 5

# += : Add and assign
x += 3    # x = x + 3
print(x)  # 8

# -= : Subtract and assign
x -= 2    # x = x - 2
print(x)  # 6

# *= : Multiply and assign
x *= 4    # x = x * 4
print(x)  # 24

# /= : Divide and assign
x /= 6    # x = x / 6
print(x)  # 4.0

# //= : Floor divide and assign
x //= 3   # x = x // 3
print(x)  # 1.0

# %= : Modulus and assign
x = 10
x %= 4    # x = x % 4
print(x)  # 2

# **= : Power and assign
x **= 3   # x = x ** 3
print(x)  # 8

# := : Walrus operator (Python 3.8+)
items = [1, 2, 3, 4]
while (length := len(items)) > 2:
    print(length)
    items.pop()
```

## Identity Operators

These check whether two variables refer to the same object in memory.

| Operator | Meaning                      | Example      |
| -------- | ---------------------------- | ------------ |
| `is`     | True if same memory location | `a is b`     |
| `is not` | True if different location   | `a is not b` |

Example

```py
a = 10
b = 20
c = a

print(a is not b)
print(a is c)
```

Output:

```
True
True
```

## Membership Operators

These check whether a value exists in a list, string, or other sequence.

| Operator | Meaning                      | Example         |
| -------- | ---------------------------- | --------------- |
| `in`     | True if value is present     | `x in list`     |
| `not in` | True if value is not present | `x not in list` |

Example:

```py
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

print("apple" in fruits)      # True
print("mango" not in fruits)  # True
```

Output:

```sh
True
True
```
