# Code of Conduct

AIcademy is a friendly place to learn about AI. We’re committed to keeping it that way.

By using AIcademy, you agree to follow this Code of Conduct.

In short: **Be kind**. **No harassment**, **trolling**, or **spamming**.

- **Harassment**: We don’t allow behavior that targets or demeans individuals or groups. This includes offensive comments, unwanted attention, doxxing, stalking, slurs, or anything that makes others feel unsafe — regardless of gender, background, identity, ability, or beliefs.

- **Trolling**: Provoking arguments, derailing discussions, or posting deliberately disruptive messages wastes everyone's time. Stay constructive and kind, even when disagreeing.

- **Spamming**: Posting irrelevant links, excessive self-promotion, or repeatedly sharing off-topic content disrupts the learning experience. Keep the space clean and focused.

If you see someone harassing, trolling, or spamming in any part of the AIcademy community (website, GitHub, discussions, discord etc.), please email us at [`hiaicademy@gmail.com`](mailto:hiaicademy@gmail.com) — ideally with a screenshot or link to the incident.

The moderator team will take any action we believe necessary to keep AIcademy a safe, respectful space — including content removal or account bans.
