# Code of Conduct
AIcademy is a friendly place to learn about AI. We’re committed to keeping it that way.

By using AIcademy, you agree to follow this Code of Conduct.

In short: **Be kind**. **No harassment**, **trolling**, or **spamming**.

**Harassment** includes offensive language or imagery, deliberate intimidation, stalking, name-calling, unwanted attention, doxxing, or any behavior that makes others feel unsafe. AIcademy should be a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity or expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, or religion (or lack thereof).

**Trolling** includes posting inflammatory, off-topic, or deliberately disruptive messages to provoke others or derail conversations.

**Spamming** includes posting irrelevant or repetitive messages, promoting products or services, unsolicited advertising, or flooding discussions with links or media.

If you see someone harassing, trolling, or spamming in any part of the AIcademy community (website, GitHub, discussions, discord etc.), please email us at `hiaicademy@gmail.com` — ideally with a screenshot or link to the incident.

The moderator team will take any action we believe necessary to keep AIcademy a safe, respectful space — including content removal or account bans.
